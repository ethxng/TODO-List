# TODO-List
In this project, I will be creating a TODO list with a "minimalistic" approach. I will be incorporating technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and webpack. 

Each Javascript file represents each page in the website. I broke it down to many files so that it is easier to read and code, rather than stuffing almost 1000 lines into one file.
